Welcome to the definitive guide for **Winter Warfare v2**. This walkthrough covers all the advanced military mechanics, air support systems, and strategic synergies available in the latest update.

## 📡 **The Radio Uplink System (New!)**
A key feature of modern warfare is communication.
- **Troop Radios**: Every **M4 Trooper** and **Commando** unit is equipped with a radio.
    - *Passive Effect:* Every 15 seconds, they will identify a target and call in a precision **Drone Airstrike** (150 Damage) from off-screen command.
- **ATC Synergy**: Building an **SR-71 Blackbird (ATC Tower)** upgrades your network.
    - *Effect:* The "Radio Uplink" status on your dashboard turns **GREEN (ATC LINKED)**.
    - *Bonus:* Troop airstrike cooldown is reduced from **15s** down to **5s**.
    - *Strategy:* A swarm of cheap Troops + 1 ATC Tower = Rain of missiles!

## ✈️ **Air Superiority (Airbases)**
Instead of placing jets directly on the ground, you now build **Forward Airbases & Hangars**.
- **Runway Mechanics:** These buildings do not shooting directly. Instead, they launch a sortie (a visible jet flying out) to attack the enemy.

| Unit | Type | Role | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F-16 Falcon** | Airbase | Fast attack fighter. Good DPS. | $1,000 |
| **F-15 Eagle** | Airbase | Heavy fighter. High damage missiles. | $1,500 |
| **F-35 Lightning** | Stealth Hangar | Multi-role stealth. Balanced stats. | $2,200 |
| **F-22 Raptor** | Stealth Hangar | Air superiority. Fast & lethal. | $3,000 |
| **B-2 Bomber** | Bomber Bunker | Heavy area bombing. Massive splash. | $4,000 |

Unmanned systems provide flexible fire support. You place **Ground Control Stations** (trailers with antennas) to pilot them.

1.  **Switchblade 600 ($400)**
    *   *Role:* Loitering Munition / Kamikaze.
    *   *Behavior:* Launches distinct cross-shaped suicide drones that crash into enemies. Rapid fire, low cost.
2.  **MQ-9 Reaper ($1,200)**
    *   *Role:* Strike Drone.
    *   *Behavior:* Launches Hellfire missiles. Good mid-game damage dealer.
3.  **Global Hawk ($1,800)**
    *   *Role:* High-altitude Support.
    *   *Behavior:* Very long range surveillance and support fire.

## 🎖️ **Strategy Guide**

### **Early Game (Waves 1-5)**
*   **Budget:** $300.
*   **Recommendation:** Buy 3 **M4 Troopers** ($100 each). Place them at the front.
*   *Why:* Their rifles handle early infantry, and their radios will occassionally snipe a tougher enemy.

### **Mid Game (Waves 10-20)**
*   **Objective:** Anti-Armor.
*   **Buy:** **Switchblade Drones** or **F-16 falcons**.
*   **Upgrade:** Build an **SR-71 ATC**. This triples the airstrike output of your starting troops, making them relevant again!

### **Late Game (Waves 30+)**
*   **Objective:** Mass Destruction.
*   **Buy:** **B-2 Spirit**. Its splash damage crushes tank columns.
*   **Support:** **Lightning Spire** or **Microwave** to slow/stun enemies while the bombers do their work.

*Good luck, Commander. The skies are yours.*
